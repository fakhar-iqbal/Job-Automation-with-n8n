# Job Application Automation Agent (n8n)

This is an **automation agent** made with **n8n** that applies for jobs automatically.  
It can pull jobs from **LinkedIn** and **Jooble**, read the job description, write a custom cover letter, find HR emails, check if the email is real, and then send the application with your resume.  
All jobs you apply for are saved in a Google Sheet.

  2. Rate the job fit  
  3. Write a cover letter  
  4. Find HR email  
  5. Verify email with MailboxLayer  
  6. Send application with Gmail

## üìù Setup Guide

### 1. Import Workflow
- Import the file `Job Applying Automated.json` into your n8n instance.  

### 2. Setup LinkedIn Jobs Flow
- Go to LinkedIn and search for jobs you want.  
- Copy the job search page link.  
- Paste it into [rss.app](https://rss.app) to make an RSS link.  
- Put that link into the **RSS Read node**.  

### 3. Setup Jooble Jobs Flow
- Open the **HTTP Request3 node**.  
- Change the JSON body to your own keywords and location, for example:  
  ```json
  {
    "keywords": "Data Scientist",
    "location": "Remote"
  }
  ```
- Jooble will return jobs based on your filters.

### 4. Connect Google Gemini
- Go to Google AI Studio and get an API key.
- In n8n, add this as Google PaLM / Gemini credentials.
- Assign this to all Gemini nodes (JOB parser, Cover letter, Rate you, Message a model, etc.).
- Keep the Wait nodes (10‚Äì20 sec) to avoid free API limits.

### 5. Connect Gmail
- In n8n, add Gmail OAuth2 credentials.
- Allow the send email scope.
- Use this in Send a message1 and Send a message2 nodes.

### 6. Setup Google Sheet
- Create a new Google Sheet.
- Add headers in the first row:
  ```
  Title | Job Description | Link | Date | Rating | Company Name | Benefits | Cover Letter | Email
  ```
- Share the sheet with the Google account connected in n8n.
- Paste the Sheet ID into the Google Sheets nodes.

### 7. Setup MailboxLayer
- Create a free account on MailboxLayer.
- Copy your API key.
- Replace the sample key in the HTTP Request7 and HTTP Request8 nodes.
- The workflow only continues if:
  - `mx_found = true` (domain accepts emails)
  - `smtp_check = true` (mailbox exists)
  - `disposable = false` (not a temp email)

### 8. Upload Resume
- Upload your resume to Google Drive.
- Copy the file ID from the share link.
- Put it into HTTP Request1 and HTTP Request6 nodes like this:
  ```
  https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=FILE_ID
  ```

### 9. Wait Nodes
- Already included to slow down execution.
- This avoids hitting free limits for Gemini or Gmail.
- You can increase or decrease the seconds as you like.
